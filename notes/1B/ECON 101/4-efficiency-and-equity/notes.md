# 4. Efficiency and Equity

**Resource Allocation Methods**
Because resources are scarce, a mechanism is needed to allocate them. The alternative methods are:

- **Market price**: Resources allocated to those willing and able to pay.
- **Command**: Resources allocated by order of authority.
- **Majority rule**: Resources allocated by majority vote.
- **Contest**: Resources allocated to the winner of a competition.
- **First-come, first-served**: Resources allocated to those first in line.
- **Lottery**: Resources allocated by chance.
- **Personal characteristics**: Resources allocated based on individual traits.
- **Force**: Resources allocated by coercion.

**Benefit, Cost, and Surplus**

- **Value** is what we get, **price** is what we pay.
- A demand curve is a **marginal benefit curve**, reflecting consumers' willingness to pay.
    - **Individual demand** is the relationship between price and quantity demanded by one person.
    - **Market demand** is the relationship for all buyers, found by horizontally summing individual demands.
- **Consumer surplus** is the **excess of the benefit received from a good over the amount paid for it**. It's the marginal benefit minus the price, summed over the quantity bought.
- A supply curve is a **marginal cost curve**, reflecting producers' minimum supply price.
    - **Individual supply** is the relationship for one producer.
    - **Market supply** is the relationship for all producers, found by horizontally summing individual supplies.
- **Producer surplus** is the **excess of the amount received from the sale of a good over the cost of producing it**. It's the price minus the marginal cost, summed over the quantity sold.
- **Total surplus** is the **sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus**.

**Is the Competitive Market Efficient?**

- In a **competitive equilibrium**, the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. At this point, **marginal social benefit equals marginal social cost**. This condition signifies **allocative efficiency**, meaning resources are used to produce goods and services that people value most highly.
- Adam Smith's "invisible hand" suggests that **buyers and sellers acting in their self-interest end up promoting the social interest** by moving resources to their highest-valued uses.
- Total surplus is maximized in an efficient market.

**Market Failure**

- A **market failure** is a situation where a market delivers an **inefficient outcome**. Inefficient production creates a **deadweight loss**, which is a social loss (a decrease in total surplus).
- Sources of market failure include:
    - **Price and quantity regulations**: Price caps or floors, and quantity limits, block price adjustments and can lead to underproduction.
    - **Taxes and subsidies**: Taxes can lead to underproduction, and subsidies to overproduction.
    - **Externalities**: Costs or benefits affecting someone other than the buyer or seller. **External costs** (e.g., pollution) lead to overproduction, while **external benefits** (e.g., knowledge) lead to underproduction.
    - **Public goods and common resources**: Issues like the "free-rider problem" with public goods and the "tragedy of the commons" with common resources prevent efficient allocation.
    - **Monopoly**: A single firm can restrict output and raise prices, leading to underproduction.
    - **High transactions costs**: The opportunity costs of making trades can sometimes prevent efficient markets.

**Is the Competitive Market Fair?**
Ideas about fairness fall into two broad groups:

- **It's not fair if the result isn't fair**: This view, exemplified by **utilitarianism**, strives for "the greatest happiness for the greatest number" and historically suggested that efficiency requires equality of incomes. However, achieving complete equality through income transfers incurs costs and inefficiencies.
    - The **big tradeoff** is the tradeoff between **efficiency and fairness**. Greater income redistribution for equality can lead to greater inefficiency (a smaller economic pie).
- **It's not fair if the rules aren't fair**: This view is based on the **symmetry principle**, which requires people in similar situations to be treated similarly (equality of opportunity). Philosopher Robert Nozick argued that fairness requires two rules:
    1. The state must enforce laws protecting **private property**.
    2. Private property can only be transferred by **voluntary exchange**.
    If these rules are followed, the outcome is considered fair, regardless of income inequality.

# 9. Perfect Competition

**Perfect competition** is a market structure characterized by **many firms each selling an identical product, many buyers, no restrictions on entry, no advantages for new entrants, and well-informed firms and buyers**. Firms in perfect competition are **price takers**, meaning they cannot influence the market price.

**Economic Profit and Revenue**

- **Total revenue (TR)** is `Price (P) x Quantity Sold (Q)`.
- **Marginal revenue (MR)** is the **change in total revenue from a one-unit increase in quantity sold**. In perfect competition, a firm's MR equals the market price.
- The firm's goal is to maximize **economic profit** (TR - total opportunity cost).

**The Firm's Output Decision**

- To maximize profit, a firm compares marginal revenue (MR) and marginal cost (MC).
- If `MR > MC`, increasing output increases profit.
- If `MR < MC`, decreasing output increases profit.
- If `MR = MC`, profit is maximized.

**Short-Run Output, Price, and Profit**

- The **short-run market supply curve** shows the quantity supplied by all firms at each price, with the number of firms and each firm's plant size fixed.
- Market demand and supply determine the equilibrium price and quantity.
- In the short run, a firm might make:
    - **Positive economic profit**: If `Price > Average Total Cost (ATC)`.
    - **Zero economic profit**: If `Price = ATC` (also called break-even point).
    - **Economic loss**: If `Price < ATC`.
- **Shutdown point**: If the price falls below **minimum average variable cost (AVC)**, the firm will **temporarily shut down** because it cannot even cover its variable costs.

**Long-Run Output, Price, and Profit**

- In the long run, firms can **enter** or **exit** the market.
- **Entry**: If firms are making positive economic profit, new firms enter, increasing market supply, which lowers the market price and reduces individual firm profits until they reach zero economic profit.
- **Exit**: If firms are incurring economic losses, existing firms exit, decreasing market supply, which raises the market price and reduces losses until they reach zero economic profit.
- In **long-run equilibrium**, **economic profit is zero**, and there is no incentive for firms to enter or exit.

**Changes in Demand and Supply as Technology Advances**

- A **permanent increase in demand** leads to a larger market output and more firms in the long run.
- **Technological advances** lower production costs, increasing supply, and in the long run lead to **lower prices and increased quantity**.

**Competition and Efficiency**

- Perfect competition achieves **allocative efficiency**.
- Resources are used efficiently when goods and services are produced in the quantities that people value most highly. This occurs when:
    - **Consumers are efficient**: They allocate their budgets to maximize value, making `Price = Marginal Benefit (MB)` on their demand curve.
    - **Producers are efficient**: They produce at the lowest possible cost, making `Price = Marginal Cost (MC)` on their supply curve.
- In competitive equilibrium, **Price = MB = MC**. Since **MB is Marginal Social Benefit (MSB)** and **MC is Marginal Social Cost (MSC)**, this means **MSB = MSC**, achieving allocative efficiency.
- Total surplus (consumer surplus + producer surplus) is maximized.

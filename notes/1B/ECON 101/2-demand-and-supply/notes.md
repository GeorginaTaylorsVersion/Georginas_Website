# 2. Demand and Supply

**Markets and Prices**

- A **competitive market** has **many buyers and many sellers**, so no single buyer or seller can influence the price. This model applies to many real-world markets like those for crude oil.
- The **money price** of an object is the number of dollars given up for it.
- The **relative price** is the ratio of the money price of one good to the money price of another, representing its **opportunity cost**. When economists say "price" will fall, they mean its relative price will fall.
- Demand and supply determine relative prices.

**Demand**
For you to **demand** something, you must want it, be able to afford it, and plan to buy it.

- **Quantity demanded** is the amount consumers plan to buy during a given time period at a particular price.
- The **Law of Demand** states: **Other things remaining the same, the higher the price of a good, the smaller is the quantity demanded; and the lower the price of a good, the greater is the quantity demanded**.
    - **Substitution effect**: When a good's price rises, its relative price (opportunity cost) rises, increasing the incentive to switch to **substitutes** (other goods used in its place).
    - **Income effect**: When a good's price rises, it decreases the quantity of goods and services you can afford, effectively shrinking your **real income**, leading to a decrease in the quantity demanded.
- The **demand curve** shows the relationship between the quantity demanded and price, holding other influences constant. It is also a **willingness-and-ability-to-pay curve**, which measures marginal benefit.
- A **demand schedule** is a table listing quantities demanded at various prices.

**Influences on Demand**:
Changes in these factors shift the demand curve:

- **Prices of related goods**:
    - **Substitutes**: If the price of a substitute rises, demand for the original good increases (shifts rightward).
    - **Complements** (goods used together): If the price of a complement rises, demand for the original good decreases (shifts leftward).
- **Expected future prices**: If the price is expected to rise, current demand increases.
- **Income**:
    - **Normal good**: Demand increases as income increases.
    - **Inferior good**: Demand decreases as income increases.
- **Expected future income and credit**: If expected future income rises or credit becomes easier, current demand increases.
- **Population**: An increase in population increases demand.
- **Preferences**: Likes and dislikes determine the value people place on goods; changes in preferences shift demand.

**Change in Quantity Demanded vs. Change in Demand**

- A **change in the quantity demanded** is a **movement along the demand curve** caused by a change in the good's own price.
- A **change in demand** is a **shift of the entire demand curve** caused by a change in any other influence on buying plans.

**Supply**
For a firm to **supply** a good, it must have the resources and technology to produce it, be able to profit from producing it, and plan to produce it.

- **Quantity supplied** is the amount producers plan to sell during a given time period at a particular price.
- The **Law of Supply** states: **Other things remaining the same, the higher the price of a good, the greater is the quantity supplied; and the lower the price of a good, the smaller is the quantity supplied**.
- The **supply curve** shows the relationship between the quantity supplied and price, holding other influences constant. It also represents the **minimum supply-price** at which producers are willing to sell an additional unit.
- A **supply schedule** is a table listing quantities supplied at various prices.

**Influences on Supply**:
Changes in these factors shift the supply curve:

- **Prices of factors of production**: If input prices rise, supply decreases.
- **Prices of related goods produced**: If the price of a substitute in production rises, supply of the original good decreases. If the price of a complement in production rises, supply of the original good increases.
- **Expected future prices**: If the price is expected to rise, current supply decreases.
- **Number of suppliers**: An increase in the number of suppliers increases supply.
- **Technology**: Advances in technology increase supply by lowering production costs.
- **State of nature**: Natural events (e.g., weather) can influence supply.

**Change in Quantity Supplied vs. Change in Supply**

- A **change in the quantity supplied** is a **movement along the supply curve** caused by a change in the good's own price.
- A **change in supply** is a **shift of the entire supply curve** caused by a change in any other influence on selling plans.

**Market Equilibrium**

- **Equilibrium price** is the price at which the **quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied**.
- **Equilibrium quantity** is the quantity bought and sold at the equilibrium price.
- When the price is **above** equilibrium, there is a **surplus** (quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded), and the price falls.
- When the price is **below** equilibrium, there is a **shortage** (quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied), and the price rises.
- The price acts as a **regulator**, coordinating buying and selling plans.

**Predicting Changes in Price and Quantity**

- **Increase in Demand**: Shifts demand curve rightward, leads to a **rise in price** and an **increase in quantity supplied**.
- **Decrease in Demand**: Shifts demand curve leftward, leads to a **fall in price** and a **decrease in quantity supplied**.
- **Increase in Supply**: Shifts supply curve rightward, leads to a **fall in price** and an **increase in quantity demanded**.
- **Decrease in Supply**: Shifts supply curve leftward, leads to a **rise in price** and a **decrease in quantity demanded**.

**Changes in Both Demand and Supply**

- **Increase in both demand and supply**: Quantity increases, price might rise or fall.
- **Decrease in both demand and supply**: Quantity decreases, price might rise or fall.
- **Decrease in demand, Increase in supply**: Price falls, quantity might increase or decrease.
- **Increase in demand, Decrease in supply**: Price rises, quantity might increase or decrease.

**Mathematical Notes on Demand and Supply**

- A demand curve can be represented by a linear equation like `P = a - bQD` where `a` is the y-axis intercept (maximum price) and `b` is the slope.
- A supply curve can be represented by a linear equation like `P = c + dQS` where `c` is the y-axis intercept (minimum supply price) and `d` is the slope.
- Market equilibrium occurs where `QD = QS`.

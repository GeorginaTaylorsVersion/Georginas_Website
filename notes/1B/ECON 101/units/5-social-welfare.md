# 5. Social Welfare

Social welfare concerns the overall well-being of society, encompassing efficiency, equity, and the broader impacts of economic decisions.

**Self-Interest vs. Social Interest**

- A central question in economics is whether choices made in the pursuit of **self-interest** (what you think is best for you) also promote the **social interest** (what is best for society as a whole).
- Economists use **incentives** as a key to reconciling self-interest and social interest. The "invisible hand" suggests that competitive markets, through self-interested actions, can lead to efficient resource allocation that benefits society.

**Efficiency and Maximizing Social Welfare**

- **Resource use is efficient if it is not possible to make someone better off without making someone else worse off**.
- **Allocative efficiency**, achieved when **marginal social benefit (MSB) equals marginal social cost (MSC)**, means resources are used to produce goods and services that people value most highly. This condition maximizes **total surplus**, which is the sum of consumer and producer surplus.
- Competitive markets can achieve allocative efficiency when there are no **externalities** or high transaction costs.

**Fairness and Social Welfare**

- Beyond efficiency, social welfare also considers **fairness** or **equity**. While there's no single crisp definition of fairness, most agree that too much inequality is unfair.
- The **utilitarianism** principle suggests striving for "the greatest happiness for the greatest number". However, attempts to redistribute income to achieve "fair results" can lead to the **big tradeoff** between efficiency and fairness. This is because redistribution can weaken incentives to work and produce, shrinking the overall "economic pie".
- The "fair rules" approach focuses on **equality of opportunity** and emphasizes the enforcement of property rights and voluntary exchange as the foundation for a fair outcome.

**Market Failures and Government Intervention for Social Welfare**
When markets fail to achieve efficient outcomes, government intervention is often considered to improve social welfare:

- **Externalities**:
    - **Negative externalities** (e.g., pollution) impose external costs, leading to **overproduction** from a social perspective. Solutions include **assigning property rights** (Coase theorem) or using **taxes/pollution charges** (Pigovian taxes) or **cap-and-trade** to internalize the external cost.
    - **Positive externalities** (e.g., knowledge from education) create external benefits, leading to **underproduction**. Solutions include **public provision**, **private subsidies**, or **vouchers** to encourage production/consumption to the efficient level.
- **Public Goods and Common Resources**: These create challenges because they are either nonrival/nonexcludable (public goods) or rival/nonexcludable (common resources), leading to the **free-rider problem** or the **tragedy of the commons**. Solutions for public goods involve public provision, and for common resources, **production quotas** or **individual transferable quotas (ITQs)**.
- **Monopoly**: Monopolies can reduce social welfare by restricting output, charging higher prices, and engaging in **rent seeking**, which is the pursuit of economic profit by diverting consumer or producer surplus, using up resources in the process.

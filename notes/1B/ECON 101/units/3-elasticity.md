# 3. Elasticity

**Elasticity** is a **units-free measure of the responsiveness** of a quantity demanded or supplied to a change in its price or other influencing factors. It allows comparison of responsiveness across different goods.

**Price Elasticity of Demand**

- The **price elasticity of demand** measures the **responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to a change in its price**, other things remaining the same.
- **Calculation**:
`Price elasticity of demand = (Percentage change in quantity demanded) / (Percentage change in price)`
or
`Price elasticity of demand = (%∆Q / %∆P)`
To calculate, use the **average price and average quantity** to measure elasticity at the midpoint between two points. Elasticity is a units-free measure because it's a ratio of two percentage changes. The absolute value is used, ignoring the minus sign.
- **Types of Price Elasticity of Demand**:
    - **Perfectly elastic demand**: Quantity demanded changes by an infinitely large percentage in response to a tiny price change (elasticity = infinity, horizontal demand curve).
    - **Elastic demand**: Percentage change in quantity demanded is *greater than* the percentage change in price (elasticity > 1).
    - **Unit elastic demand**: Percentage change in quantity demanded *equals* the percentage change in price (elasticity = 1).
    - **Inelastic demand**: Percentage change in quantity demanded is *less than* the percentage change in price (elasticity between 0 and 1).
    - **Perfectly inelastic demand**: Quantity demanded remains constant when the price changes (elasticity = 0, vertical demand curve).
- **Factors Influencing Price Elasticity of Demand**:
    - **Closeness of substitutes**: The closer the substitutes, the more elastic the demand. Necessities (poor substitutes) tend to have inelastic demand; luxuries (many substitutes) tend to have elastic demand.
    - **Proportion of income spent on the good**: The larger the proportion of income spent, the more elastic the demand.
    - **Time elapsed since the price change**: The longer the time elapsed, the more elastic the demand.
- **Elasticity Along a Linear Demand Curve**: A linear demand curve has a constant slope but varying elasticity. It is elastic above the midpoint, unit elastic at the midpoint, and inelastic below the midpoint.
- **Total Revenue Test**: This method uses the relationship between price changes and total revenue to determine elasticity:
    - If demand is **elastic**, a price cut **increases total revenue** (and a price rise decreases it).
    - If demand is **inelastic**, a price cut **decreases total revenue** (and a price rise increases it).
    - If demand is **unit elastic**, a price cut **leaves total revenue unchanged** (it's at its maximum).

**More Elasticities of Demand**

- **Income Elasticity of Demand**: Measures the **responsiveness of demand for a good to a change in income**, other things remaining the same.
`Income elasticity of demand = (Percentage change in quantity demanded) / (Percentage change in income)`
    - **Normal good**: Income elasticity is **positive**.
        - **Income elastic**: Income elasticity > 1 (e.g., airline travel, movies); percentage increase in quantity demanded is greater than percentage increase in income.
        - **Income inelastic**: Income elasticity between 0 and 1 (e.g., food, clothing); percentage increase in quantity demanded is positive but less than percentage increase in income.
    - **Inferior good**: Income elasticity is **negative** (demand decreases as income increases).
- **Cross Elasticity of Demand**: Measures the **responsiveness of demand for a good to a change in the price of a substitute or complement**, other things remaining the same.
`Cross elasticity of demand = (Percentage change in quantity demanded of good 1) / (Percentage change in price of good 2)`
    - **Substitutes**: Cross elasticity is **positive**. If the price of one increases, the quantity demanded of the other increases.
    - **Complements**: Cross elasticity is **negative**. If the price of one increases, the quantity demanded of the other decreases.
    - **Unrelated goods**: Cross elasticity is **zero**.

**Elasticity of Supply**

- The **elasticity of supply** measures the **responsiveness of the quantity supplied to a change in the price of a good**, other things remaining the same.
- **Calculation**:
`Elasticity of supply = (Percentage change in quantity supplied) / (Percentage change in price)`
- **Types of Elasticity of Supply**:
    - **Perfectly inelastic supply**: Quantity supplied is fixed regardless of price (elasticity = 0, vertical supply curve).
    - **Unit elastic supply**: Percentage change in price equals percentage change in quantity (elasticity = 1). A linear supply curve passing through the origin is unit elastic.
    - **Elastic supply**: Elasticity > 1.
    - **Perfectly elastic supply**: Sellers willing to offer any quantity for sale at a given price (elasticity = infinity, horizontal supply curve).
- **Factors Influencing Elasticity of Supply**:
    - **Resource substitution possibilities**: If resources can be easily reallocated to produce other goods, supply is more elastic.
    - **Time frame for the supply decision**:
        - **Momentary supply**: Response at the instant of price change (often perfectly inelastic).
        - **Short-run supply**: Response after some technologically feasible adjustments.
        - **Long-run supply**: Response after all technologically feasible adjustments. The longer the time frame, the more elastic the supply.

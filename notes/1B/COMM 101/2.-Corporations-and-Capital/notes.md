### Unit 2: Corporations and Capital

This unit explains how corporations are formed and how capital is created, focusing on their legal forms and financial structures.

### Types of Businesses in Canada

In Canada, the three primary forms of business ownership are: **Sole Proprietorship**, **Partnership**, and **Corporation**. They differ in creation, duration, taxation, owner liability, transferability, and management.

- **Sole Proprietorship:**
    - **Easiest and least costly to create**. Often just requires registering the business name.
    - There is **no legal distinction between the owner and the business entity**.
    - The owner receives all profits and has **unlimited responsibility for all losses and debts**.
    - The business's assets and debts are those of the proprietor.
- **Partnership:** (Mentioned as one of the three types but not detailed in the provided sources beyond being a type).
- **Corporation:**
    - A **legal entity, separate and distinct from its owners and managers**, existing under government authority.
    - In Canada, recognized by law as having the same rights and obligations as a natural person, able to purchase assets, enter contracts, borrow, sue, earn income.
    - **Assets and liabilities are owned by the corporation**, not the shareholders or managers. It is the most common form of business ownership today.

### Advantages to Incorporation

Incorporating a business offers several advantages due to its status as a separate legal entity:

- **Limited Liability for Shareholders**: The **maximum loss for any shareholder is the amount of money they invested**. Banks must look to the corporation, not shareholders, for repayment.
    - **Caveat for Small Businesses**: Many banks require **personal guarantees** from the main shareholder, making them liable for the full loan amount.
- **Continuous Existence**: As long as financially healthy, a corporation can **live forever**; death of shareholders or managers does not end its life.
- **Flexibility in Ownership**: Shareholders can **increase or decrease their ownership by buying or selling shares** without affecting business operations. Allows for differing levels of ownership.
- **Greater Access to Capital**: Corporations have **more access to capital** (debt or equity) than other forms. Banks and governments prefer lending/granting to corporations due to continuous existence, separate legal entity, and flexible ownership.
- **Tax Benefits**: In Canada, small businesses enjoy a **lower tax rate** on their first $500,000 of business income.

### Disadvantages to Incorporation

Despite advantages, incorporation has drawbacks:

- **Cost**: Creating a corporation is a **legal process with filing, legal, and registration fees**, significantly higher than other business forms.
- **More Administrative Requirements**: Requires more ongoing administration, including annual tax returns, corporate record maintenance, directors' and shareholders' meetings, and annual information filings.
- **More Complex Operational Structure**: Every corporation must have **shareholders, directors, and officers**, each with distinct roles and legal requirements, even if one person fills all roles in the smallest corporations.

### Operational Structure

The operational structure defines the roles within a corporation:

- **Shareholders**:
    - The **owners** of the corporation, entitled to profits (if any).
    - Profits are distributed as **dividends**, but only if declared by the board of directors.
    - **Voting shareholders elect the directors**.
- **Directors**:
    - Responsible for the **management of the corporation**, usually by appointing officers.
    - Can declare dividends, call shareholder meetings, adopt/amend bylaws, and issue shares.
    - Have a **legal requirement to act with reasonable ability, disclose conflicts of interest**, and refrain from personal gain at the corporation's expense.
    - The **Board of Directors** refers to the entire group of directors.
- **Officers**:
    - Responsible for the **day-to-day running of the business**.
    - Duties include hiring employees, paying suppliers, sales, purchasing assets, arranging loans.
    - Usually have authority to **issue debt (borrow)** but not shares (which needs board approval).
    - Have a duty to **act in the best interests of the corporation**, avoiding self-dealing and not favoring any single shareholder group.

### The Process to Incorporate a Business

In Canada, the **Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA)** governs federal incorporation, administered by **Corporations Canada**.

1. **Step 1: Select a Name**: The name must be **distinguishable from existing businesses** and include a legal identifier such as "Incorporated (Inc.)", "Limited (Ltd.)", or "Corporation (Corp.)". The name cannot be misleading or obscene. A name search is required.
2. **Step 2: Submit Documentation for the Issue of a Certificate of Incorporation**: The **Articles of Incorporation** describe the essential features of the corporation (e.g., name, location, number of directors, share classes). Upon approval and submission of fees, Corporations Canada issues a **Certificate of Incorporation**, bringing the corporation into existence.
3. **Step 3: Set Bylaws and Issue Shares**: An **organizational meeting** must be held to set bylaws, appoint officers, make banking arrangements, and **shares must be issued**. Bylaws include rules for year-end, banking, officer duties, and meeting procedures.
4. **Step 4: Hold a Shareholders' Meeting**: Within the first 18 months, directors must hold the first shareholders' meeting, where shareholders **elect directors, approve/reject bylaws, and appoint an auditor**.

### Share Structure

Shares represent ownership of the corporation. A corporation must create at least one class of shares, each with potential rights including:

- **Right to vote** at shareholders' meetings.
- **Right to receive dividends** (subject to board approval and financial ability).
- **Right to information**.
- **Right to receive the remaining property upon liquidation**.
- **Common Shares**: Generally carry the right to vote, the right to dividends, and the right to receive residual property upon liquidation. However, these rights come **after repaying all debt and preferred shares**. Common shares carry **both the highest risk and the highest potential for profit**.
- **Preferred Shares**: Generally carry a **preferred right to dividends** (ahead of common shares) and a **preferred right to receive residual property upon liquidation** (ahead of common shares but after debt repayment).

### Liquidation of a Corporation

**Liquidation** (or winding up) is the process where a corporation will **cease to exist**, and its assets are sold.

- **Creditor Distinction**:
    - A **secured creditor** has a legally registered claim against specific assets.
    - An **unsecured creditor** has advanced funds without any security.
- **Order of Proceeds Distribution**:
    1. **Secured Creditors**.
    2. **Unsecured Creditors**.
    3. **Preferred Shareholders**.
    4. **Common Shareholders**.
    Common shareholders bear the most risk in liquidation, but also gain the most if the business succeeds.

### Historical Survey of Investment Returns

**Investment** is the **commitment of resources to achieve a return**. Financial intermediaries (banks, brokers, insurers, pension funds, and mutual funds) connect investors (those with money) and investees (those who need money).

- **Broad Categories of Investments**: All investments generally fall into:
    - **Debt**: Money that is **loaned and must be repaid** at some future time, usually with interest. Can be secured or unsecured. Lending to governments (e.g., Canada) is considered virtually **risk-free**. Corporate and individual debt carry varying levels of risk.
    - **Equity**: An **ownership interest in a business**. Equity holders are only paid after all debt holders in a liquidation. Investors make money in two ways: **dividends from future profits or selling ownership for a capital gain**.
    - **Derivatives**: Financial contracts whose **value is derived from the value of something else** (e.g., stock, interest rate, commodity, index). An option to purchase common stock is a derivative.
- **Security**: In an investment context, a **security is an investment that is readily tradable**. Bonds, common and preferred shares of public companies, and options are considered securities because they trade publicly. A car loan, for example, is debt but not a security because it doesn't trade publicly.
- **Historical Risk and Return**:
    - Every investment carries unique **risk and return characteristics**.
    - Investors generally expect **higher returns from investments that carry higher risk**.
    - **Inflation** is important as a reference rate; if an investor does not earn more than inflation, they are **losing purchasing power**.
    - **Indicative Total Rates of Returns by Asset Class (1976-2015)**:
        - Over the long term, **U.S. stocks outperformed other asset classes**.
        - The average annual compound return for **U.S. stocks was 11.4%**, reflecting higher risk than debt. Stocks also had the **highest volatility**. They are suitable for investors who do not need to cash in investments soon and can afford market downturns, such as **long-term retirement savings plans**.
        - **10-year U.S. treasury bills** returned 7.4%, which was **2.7% higher than 3-month treasury bills**, reflecting the higher risk of longer maturity. They are more secure than corporate bonds and provide a positive return over the medium term (3+ years).
        - **Corporate bonds** returned 8.1%, which was 3.3% lower than stocks but higher than U.S. treasuries, reflecting their intermediate risk. They compensate investors for taking on more credit risk.
        - **3-month U.S. treasury bills** had the **lowest return (4.7%) and lowest volatility**. They are a good choice for investors with short-term plans or who cannot afford to lose money, such as **emergency funds or short-term savings**.
        - **Negative returns are possible** for 10-year treasury bonds, corporate bonds, and stocks.
    - **Timing the Market**: Refers to trying to buy into a market when it is at a low and sell when it is at a high. It is considered **virtually impossible to consistently time the market**. Historical examples demonstrate the significant timing risk for stock investors.

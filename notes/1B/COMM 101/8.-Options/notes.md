# 8. Options

This unit introduces options, their terminology, and basic concepts.

- **Definition**: An option is a **financial contract in which the value of the contract is derived from the value of something else**. That "something else" can be an individual common stock, an interest rate, a commodity, or an index.
- **Terminology**:
    - **Call Option**: Gives the holder the **right to buy** an underlying asset at a specified price.
    - **Put Option**: Gives the holder the **right to sell** an underlying asset at a specified price.
    - **Strike Price (Exercise Price)**: The specified price at which the underlying asset can be bought or sold.
    - **Expiration Date (Maturity)**: The date by which the option must be exercised or it expires worthless. Options are available for maturities from 1 day up to 3 years.
    - **In-the-Money**: A call option is in-the-money if the underlying asset's price is above the strike price; a put option is in-the-money if the underlying asset's price is below the strike price. This means the option has intrinsic value.
    - **Out-of-the-Money**: A call option is out-of-the-money if the underlying asset's price is below the strike price; a put option is out-of-the-money if the underlying asset's price is above the strike price. This means the option has no intrinsic value.
- **Payoff vs. Profit**: (Implied, but not explicitly defined as terms in provided text, typically refers to the value of the option at expiration vs. the return after deducting the premium paid).
- **Basic Pricing Relationships**: (Implied that the value of an option is derived from the value of the underlying stock, and more complex pricing models exist).
- **Strategies from Notes**: (Review of specific option strategies would be covered in course lectures or notes not fully provided).
- **General Information**: Options are readily tradable securities. They can be traded publicly. Investors can enter limit orders, market orders, stop-loss or stop-buy orders, sell short, and buy on margin for options, similar to stocks and ETFs.
